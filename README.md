# pygax: Genetic Algorithm Exercises and Demoes in python

This code is created to support exercises and tutorials in a
taught module on artificial intelligence.  The implementation 
is meant to be conceptually simple and flexible, at the expense 
of speed.  Also, error checks have generally not been implemented,
and there has been no attempt to pack it up as a proper python
module for reuse.

The code is crude.  Please suggest improvements.
